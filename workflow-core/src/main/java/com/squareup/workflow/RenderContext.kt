/**
 * Facilities for a [Workflow] to interact with other [Workflow]s and the outside world from inside
 * a `render` function.
 *
 * ## Handling events from the UI
 *
 * While a workflow's rendering can represent whatever you need it to, it is common for the
 * rendering to contain the data for some part of your UI. In addition to shuttling data to the UI,
 * the rendering can also contain functions that the UI can call to send events to the workflow.
 *
 * E.g.
 * ```
 * data class Rendering(
 *   val radioButtonTexts: List<String>,
 *   val onSelected: (index: Int) -> Unit
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * To create populate such functions from your `render` method, you first need to define a
 * [WorkflowAction] to handle the event by changing state, emitting an output, or both. Then, just
 * pass a lambda to your rendering that instantiates the action and passes it to
 * [actionSink.send][Sink.send].
 *
 * ## Performing asynchronous work
 *
 * See [runningWorker].
 *
 * ## Composing children
 *
 * See [renderChild].
